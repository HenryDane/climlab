MeridionalHeatDiffusion does not work with lon

AplusBT does not like this setup:
    state = climlab.column_state(num_lev=10)
    model = climlab.TimeDependentProcess(state=state)
    model.add_subprocess(climlab.radiation.aplusbt.AplusBT())

RRTMG suspect is 
    application of insolation (check DailyInsolation, etc)
    ConvectiveAdjustment?
        #  For now, let's assume that the vertical axis is the last axis
        
DailyInsolation says (L556)
    if 'lon' in dom.axes:
        # insolation is latitude-only, need to broadcast across longitude
        #  assumption is axes are ordered (lat, lon, depth)
        #  NOTE this is a clunky hack and all this will go away
        #  when we use xarray structures for these internals
        insolation = np.tile(insolation[...,np.newaxis], dom.axes['lon'].num_points)        
        
why does meridional_heat_diffusion.py:L87 look like this:
    for varname, value in self.state.items():
        heat_capacity = value.domain.heat_capacity
    # diffusivity in units of m**2/s
    self.K = self.D / heat_capacity * const.a**2
